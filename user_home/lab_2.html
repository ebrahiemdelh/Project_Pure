                                    <p>Cross-site scripting (also known as XSS) is a web security vulnerability that
                                        allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have with a
                                        vulnerable application.</p>

                                    <p>Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities normally allow an attacker to masquerade as
                                        a victim user, to carry out any actions that the user can perform, and to access
                                        any of the user's data.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Most websites and web applications run client-side code in the web browser using
                                    some kind of dynamic scripting language. In a vast majority of cases, this language
                                    is JavaScript. </li>
                                <li>Pure HTML websites and web applications still exist, but they are a rare sight
                                    simply because client-side scripts greatly enhance the user interface and
                                    capabilities of the website or web application.</li>
                                <li>You can safely assume that more than 99% of websites and web applications you come
                                    across include client-side JavaScript code.</li>
                                <li>This, in turn, means that user browsers must be able to interpret any JavaScript
                                    code on behalf of the web application.</li>
                                <li>Most web applications and websites also interact with users in some way, even if
                                    they don’t use JavaScript.</li>
                                <li>Interaction requires some form of user input.</li>
                                <li>For example, the user may need to type their username to log in to the web
                                    application and the application may display that username later in the user
                                    interface.</li>
                                <li>This means that the application processes user input and then outputs it in the web
                                    browser.</li>
                                <li>Combined, these two conditions lay the foundation for the most common web security
                                    vulnerability – cross-site scripting, which is a type of injection attack.</li>
                                <li>If an attacker is able to include JavaScript code in a user input parameter and the
                                    application directly returns that code in its HTML output and sends it to the client
                                    browser, the browser will execute the malicious JavaScript.</li>
                                <li>Whenever a web page directly echoes user input, attackers will be able to run
                                    malicious scripts in the client browser, even if the page itself is built only with
                                    static HTML tags and includes no JavaScript.</li>
                                <li>Unlike most other web application vulnerabilities, this one does not directly affect
                                    the back end of the application (the web server).</li>
                                <li>It affects regular users of the web application or victims who are tricked into
                                    accessing it.</li>
                                <li>XSS is also possible for some APIs that allow JavaScript, for example, an API may
                                    present the user with an error message that contains JavaScript previously injected
                                    by an attacker.</li>
                                <li>For many years, cross-site scripting had its own separate category in the OWASP Top
                                    10.</li>
                                <li>However, in 2021, the creators of the list decided to incorporate it into the
                                    Injection category along with SQL injection, RCE and many more.</li>

                                <ol>
                                    <li>Reflected XSS, where the malicious script comes from the current HTTP request.

                                    <li>Stored XSS, where the malicious script comes from the website's database.</li>
                                    <li>DOM-based XSS, where the vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than
                                        server-side code.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <li>If there is nothing to prevent a user from entering "wrong" input, the user can
                                    enter some "smart" input like this:</li>

                                <li>Reflected XSS is the simplest variety of cross-site scripting.</li>
                                <li>It arises when an application receives data in an HTTP request and includes that
                                    data within the immediate response in an unsafe way.</li>
                                <li>Here is a simple example of a reflected XSS vulnerability:<a
                                        href="https://insecure-website.com/status?message=All+is+well.<p>Status: All is well.</p>"
                                        target="_blank">Click Here</a></li>
                                <li>The application doesn't perform any other processing of the data, so an attacker can
                                    easily construct an attack like this:<a
                                        href="https://insecure-website.com/status?message=<script>/*+Bad+stuff+here...+*/</script><p>Status: <script>/* Bad stuff here... */</script></p>"
                                        target="_blank">Click Here</a></li>
                                <li>If the user visits the URL constructed by the attacker, then the attacker's script

                                <li>Stored XSS (also known as persistent or second-order XSS) arises when an application
                                    receives data from an untrusted source and includes that data within its later HTTP
                                    responses in an unsafe way.</li>
                                <li>The data in question might be submitted to the application via HTTP requests; for
                                    example, comments on a blog post, user nicknames in a chat room, or contact details
                                    on a customer order.</li>
                                <li>In other cases, the data might arrive from other untrusted sources; for example, a
                                    webmail application displaying messages received over SMTP, a marketing application
                                    displaying social media posts, or a network monitoring application displaying packet
                                    data from network traffic.</li>
                                <li>Here is a simple example of a stored XSS vulnerability. A message board application
                                    lets users submit messages, which are displayed to other users:</li>
                                <li>
                                    <h2>Example</h2>
                                </li>
                                <pre><code>
                                    <span>&lt;p&gt;Hello, this is my message!&lt;/p&gt;</span>
                                </code></pre>
                                <li>The application doesn't perform any other processing of the data, so an attacker can
                                    easily send a message that attacks other users:</li>
                                <pre><code>
                                    <span>&lt;p&gt;&lt;script&gt;Bad Stuff Here... &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</span>

                                <li>DOM-based XSS (also known as DOM XSS) arises when an application contains some
                                    client-side JavaScript that processes data from an untrusted source in an unsafe
                                    way, usually by writing the data back to the DOM.</li>
                                <li>In the following example, an application uses some JavaScript to read the value from
                                    an input field and write that value to an element within the HTML:</li>
                                <pre><code>
                                    <span>var search = document.getElementById('search').value;</span>
                                    <span>var results = document.getElementById('results');</span>
                                    <span>results.innerHTML = 'You searched for: ' + search;</span>
                                </code></pre>
                                <li>If the attacker can control the value of the input field, they can easily construct
                                    a malicious value that causes their own script to execute:</li>
                                <pre><code>
                                    <span>You Have Searched for &lt;img src=1 onerror='/* Bad Stuff Here... */'&gt;</span>
                                </code></pre>
                                <li>In a typical case, the input field would be populated from part of the HTTP request,
                                    such as a URL query string parameter, allowing the attacker to deliver an attack
                                    using a malicious URL, in the same manner as reflected XSS.</li>

                                <li>The 2005 Samy worm – in October 2005, Samy Kamkar, a user of the MySpace social
                                    media platform, created an experiment that was supposed to be a fun prank and turned
                                    into a nightmare. He included JavaScript code in the content of a MySpace message
                                    board post. When Samy’s page was visited by anyone, this code would be executed by
                                    the user
                                    browser and would post the same comment to the victim’s profile. Within 20 hours,
                                    the XSS worm reached over one million MySpace users. For his prank, Kamkar was
                                    raided
                                    in 2006 by the US Secret Service and ended up with a plea agreement – three years
                                    probation with no access to the Internet.</li>
                                <li>In 2011, attackers used a Facebook XSS vulnerability to launch a self-propagating
                                    spam worm similar to the original Samy worm. The vulnerability was located in the
                                    Facebook Mobile API. The attackers created a web page with a specially crafted
                                    iframe element that forced all visiting Facebook users to post unauthorized messages
                                    on their walls, getting more users to visit the same page. This was one of many XSS
                                    vulnerabilities on social media sites, and others continue to surface even today.

                                <li>The British Airways 2018 breach – this was probably the most famous XSS breach so
                                    far that led to the theft of sensitive data. The attackers, suspected to be part of
                                    the Magecart organization, used an XSS vulnerability to skim personal and payment
                                    information of up to 380,000 British Airways customers. While it was not a classic
                                    stored XSS attack, the attackers managed to place malicious scripts on British
                                    Airways payment websites that sent sensitive information to a server under the
                                    attackers’ control. Similar Magecart attacks happened before and keep happening even
                                    today but usually, the scope of the attack is narrower.</li>
